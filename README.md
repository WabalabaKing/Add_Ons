# Add_Ons
Add-on for Job application. Mainly papers, pictures, deliverables...Fancy stuff that I ended achieving!
# Contents: 
**1.Computational Design and Experimental Testing of a Flexible Bi-Stable Airfoil for Passive Flow Control**

  Published conference paper for AIAA Aviation forum 2021, focuses on the topology optimization of morphing strucutre, and its validation in CFD and windtunnel
  
**2.Final Design Proposal AIAA Design Competition 2021**

  Final Design Proposal for a light attack aircraft. Sadly this didnt win us a prize.
  
**3.Mission Adaptive Lifting System Design Using Integrated Multidisciplinary Topology Optimization**

  Published Conference Paper for AIAA Aviation and Aeronautics 2020, serves as a proof of concept for morphing airfoil, and how they may out perform optimized conventional airfoil in an operation with multiple flight conditions
  
**4. Optimal Routing in Stochastic Networks with Reliability Guarantees**


  Published Conference paper in 2021 IEEE ITSC, serves to formualte and realize an algorithm that balances between reliability and speed in stochastic network
  
  
**5.AE416_Term_Project**

 Project Proposal for application of CNN in airfoil optimization... Just the proposal for now, the real deal should be here about end of the semester (I hope)
